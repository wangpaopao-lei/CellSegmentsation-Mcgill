/home/lei/miniconda3/envs/CS/lib/python3.9/site-packages/spaghetti/network.py:40: FutureWarning:

The next major release of pysal/spaghetti (2.0.0) will drop support for all ``libpysal.cg`` geometries. This change is a first step in refactoring ``spaghetti`` that is expected to result in dramatically reduced runtimes for network instantiation and operations. Users currently requiring network and point pattern input as ``libpysal.cg`` geometries should prepare for this simply by converting to ``shapely`` geometries.
